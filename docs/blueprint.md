## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#7957D6) to convey creativity and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F4F3F7), a desaturated near-white that lets the violet stand out.
- Accent color: Lilac (#B294F2) to add a soft, complementary contrast to the violet.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif with an elegant and contemporary feel, suits both headings and body text.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent ingredients, categories, and functions.
- Implement a clean, modular layout that supports clear data presentation and easy navigation across formulation, inventory, and compliance modules.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations when scaling formulas, visualizing pyramids, and receiving AI suggestions.
